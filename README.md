# PID Control for Inverted Pendulum

This repository contains the implementation and analysis of PID controllers for controlling an inverted pendulum. The project involves designing and testing PID controllers on linear and nonlinear models to stabilize the pendulum at its upright position.

## Repository Structure

- **MainCodes/**  
  Contains all the MATLAB scripts used for the project, including code for system identification, PID design, and analysis.

- **Report/**  
  Includes a comprehensive report detailing the methodology, theoretical background, design process, and results of the project.

- **Simulations/**  
  Contains Simulink models and simulations demonstrating the behavior of the inverted pendulum under different PID control strategies.

## Highlights

- PID controllers designed using methods like Ziegler-Nichols, extended Ziegler-Nichols, and CHR.
- Performance analysis on both linearized and nonlinear models.
- Simulations illustrating the effectiveness and limitations of PID control for nonlinear systems.
